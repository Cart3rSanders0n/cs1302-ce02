## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you have setup
your local machine following the instructions linked to on eLC and the syllabus.

1. Launch your terminal emulator and create the following directory hierarchy: 'exercise2/src/cs1302/example'
   What single command can be used to create this directory structure?

2. Within the 'example' directory, create a file called 'Hello.java'. Inside of the file, write a basic Hello, world
   java program using your favorite text editor (emacs or vi).

3. Within the Hello.java file, write code to place this file in the 'cs1302.example' package.

4. From the 'exercise2' directory, make a directory called 'bin'. This folder will hold the byte code (.class files) for 
   our program.

5. From the 'exercise2' directory, what is a single command to compile the 'Hello.java' file and place the .class file in
   the 'bin' directory?

6. From the 'exercise2' directory, what is the single command to run the 'Hello' java program?

7. From your home directory (not 'exercise2'), what is the single command to run the 'Hello' java program?

* **CHECKPOINT**
8. Create a utility package under the cs1302 package.  In it, create a Methods class that has a method to return the max of two
   integers.

9. What is the command to compile the new Methods class?

10. Now, call the max method from your Hello.java file (in a different package).  How would you call the method without importing
    the cs1302.utility package?
